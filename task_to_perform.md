predict if the review is positive or negative. this a simple example of the application of natural language processingbut the algorithm we well make in this part will be very well applicable to other 
kinds of texts.  you will be able to apply this on books. for example to predict the genre of a book to know whether the book is a comedy. a thriller or a romance. newspapers and so on..
