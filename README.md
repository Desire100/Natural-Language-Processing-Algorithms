# Natural-Language-Processing-Algorithms
NLP is applying machine learning models to text and language.  Teaching machines to understand what is said in spoken and written word is the focus of Natural Language Processing. whenever  you dictate something into your electronic device that is the converted to text, that's NLP algorithm in action.

In this section you will understand and learn how to clean to prepare them for machine learning models, create bag of words model and apply machine learning models onto this bag words model.

Definition: NLP is the area of computer science and Artificial Intelligence concerned with interactions between computers and human or natural languages.

In general so that we have an idea of NLP let's takw a look at some uses we have:  
    1. Sentiment analysis or identify the mood or subjective opinions within large text. we are going to build a similar model in this            section with restaurant reviews being positive or negative but you can also use it to predict the genre of a book use it for              question and trade with chat bot. you could also use it to buuild a machine translator or a speech recognition system along with          document summarization.

   2. Main NLP library examples:
       Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
       SpaCy
       Stanford NLP
       OpenNLP
       
   3. for the purpose of the practical work in this project you will be workind with the bag of words model. it's a highly popular and 
      relevant NLP. in this part you will understand and learn how to clean text and prepare them for machine learning models, create a 
      bag of words models and applly ML models onto this bag of words.
